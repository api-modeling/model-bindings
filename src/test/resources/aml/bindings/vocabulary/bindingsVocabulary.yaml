    description: |
      Set of Binding Decclarations that map transformations from the
      data model to a particular format

  BindingDeclaration:
    displayName: Binding Declaration
    description: |
      Base concept for all declarations of binding transformations.
      Bindings are basically mappings from nodes in the model to nodes
      in the graph describing the target format of the binding.

  Binding:
    displayName: Binding
    description: |
      A binding for a data model element. It links a node in the model to a
      BindingDeclaration in a Binding Profile. It can be seen as the application
      of a function that transforms the data model element into a node in the
      graph describing the profile format.
